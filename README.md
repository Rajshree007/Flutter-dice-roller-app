# 🎲 Online Dice Roller App (Flutter)

This is a simple and fun **Flutter application** that simulates rolling a six-sided dice. Every time you tap the **"Roll"** button, it randomly displays one of six dice face images — just like a real dice!

## 📱 Features

- 🎲 Random dice face generation (1 to 6)
- 🖼️ Dice images displayed with smooth UI
- 🚀 Lightweight and fast
- 🖱️ "Roll" button to trigger dice roll
- ✅ Fully responsive for Android and iOS

## 💡 How It Works

When the user taps the **Roll** button:
- A random number from 1 to 6 is generated.
- The corresponding dice face image (`dice1.png` to `dice6.png`) is displayed.
- Works offline after assets are bundled.
